# Rust Revisions

This repository contains a series of examples and exercises designed to help you learn Rust, from basic concepts to more advanced topics. It covers fundamental principles such as ownership, control flow, and error handling, as well as practical applications of data structures like vectors and hash maps.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following chapters:

### ✅ 1. Primitive Data Types
Understand the basic data types in Rust, such as integers, booleans, and characters, and how they are used to manage simple data.

### ✅ 2. Compound Data Types
Explore tuples and arrays, which allow you to store multiple values in a structured way.

### ✅ 3. Functions
Learn how to define and call functions to organize your code and improve reusability.

### 4. Ownership
Dive into Rust’s unique ownership system, which ensures memory safety without the need for a garbage collector.

### 5. Borrowing and References
Master Rust’s approach to references and borrowing, allowing you to safely access data without taking ownership.

### 6. Variables and Mutability
Understand how variables are handled in Rust, including the distinction between mutable and immutable variables.

### 7. Constants
Discover how constants provide a way to define immutable values with a fixed, global scope.

### 8. Shadowing
Learn how shadowing enables you to reuse variable names within a specific scope.

### 9. Comments
Understand the importance of comments and how to document your Rust code effectively.

### 10. Introduction to Control Flow
Learn how to use conditional statements like `if-else` to control the execution flow based on conditions.

### 11. Looping Mechanisms
Explore Rust’s `loop`, `while`, and `for` constructs for repeated execution of code.

### 12. Defining Structs
Learn how to create custom data types using structs to group related values together.

### 13. Introduction to Enums
Understand how enums can be used to define types with multiple variants, improving code clarity and safety.

### 14. Error Handling Techniques
Learn about Rust’s robust error-handling mechanisms using `Result` and `Option` types.

### 15. Collection Types
Master advanced data structures for efficient data management:
- **Vectors**: Growable arrays for managing dynamic lists.
- **Strings**: UTF-8 encoded, dynamically allocated text.
- **Hash Maps**: Key-value storage for quick data retrieval.
